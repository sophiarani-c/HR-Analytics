# Problem Statement

The problem for the company was that they were in a hybrid mode of working i.e some employees are coming to office to work and some are working from home. They wanted insights on the Attendance/Presence of the employees for their past 3 months of data.

Some of their concerns were:
* Knowing the percentage presence of employees
* Working Preferences, either work from home or coming to work
* Knowing how many people are taking sick leaves.
