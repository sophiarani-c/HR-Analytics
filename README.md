# Problem Statement

The problem for the company was that they were in a hybrid mode of working i.e some employees are coming to office to work and some are working from home. They wanted insights on the Attendance/Presence of the employees for their past 3 months of data.

Some of their concerns were:
* Knowing the percentage presence of employees
* Working Preferences, either work from home or coming to work
* Knowing how many people are taking sick leaves.

# Insights from the Dashboard

During the three-month period, attendance percentages fluctuated, peaking in April and declining in May, likely due to the summer vacation season. Overall attendance averaged 91.8%. There was a notable increase in Work From Home (WFH) percentages, particularly on Fridays, while Sick Leave rates were higher on Mondays. Interestingly, employees with 100% WFH had perfect attendance. Between June 9 and June 17, 2022, WFH percentages showed a significant upward trend, rising by 9.2%. However, Sick Leave percentages spiked unexpectedly on Monday, June 13, 2022, reaching 3.80%, surpassing the anticipated range of 2.98% to 3.35%. 

# Suggestion
Considering these trends, transitioning to a hybrid model—incorporating three days in-office and two days WFH per week—could optimize resources, potentially reducing rental expenses if additional space is required.
